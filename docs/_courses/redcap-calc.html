prerequisites: "A laptop and REDCap account."
learn: "Though it isn't immediately obvious in the web interface, REDCap supports the use of formulas in both branching logic and calculation fields. Clever use of formulas not only allow for automated data analysis, but also for customized display logic, real-time data screening, and pseudo-randomization. We will:
<ul><li>use formulas to implement reverse scoring and standardized score lookup</li>
    <li>use functions for date calculations and string matching</li>
    <li>use regex to define custom string validations</li>
    <li>use modulo calculations to allow for pseudo-randomization</li></ul>"
